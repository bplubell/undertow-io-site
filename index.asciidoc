Undertow
========

Undertow
--------

Undertow is a flexible performant web server written in java, providing both blocking and non-blocking API's based on NIO.

Undertow has a composition based architecture that allows you to build a web server by combining small single purpose
handlers. The gives you the flexibility to choose between a full Java EE servlet 3.1 container, or a low level non-blocking
handler, to anything in between.

Undertow is designed to be fully embeddable, with easy to use fluent builder APIs. Undertow's lifecycle is completely
controlled by the embeding application.

Undertow is sponsored by JBoss and is the default web server in the link:github.com/wildfly/wildfly[Wildfly Application Server].


Show me the code

Ok then. Here is a simple Hello World server using Async IO:

[source,java]
----
public class HelloWorldServer {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        Undertow server = Undertow.builder()
                .addListener(8080, "localhost")
                .setDefaultHandler(new HttpHandler() {
                    @Override
                    public void handleRequest(final HttpServerExchange exchange) throws Exception {
                        exchange.getResponseHeaders().put(Headers.CONTENT_TYPE, "text/plain");
                        exchange.getResponseSender().send("Hello World");
                    }
                }).build();
        server.start();
    }
}
