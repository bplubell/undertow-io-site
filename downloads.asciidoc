The easiest way to get started using Undertow is to download the
link:http://www.wildfly.org/downloads/[Wildfly Application Server].

Undertow is the default web server in Wildfly, so usage is as simple as deploying a war.

Maven
~~~~~

If you want to embed Undertow then you will most likely want to use Maven. There are currently three version branches
for Undertow:

1.0::
    This is the original version of Undertow that has support for Java 6, and is the branch that is present in
    Wildfly 8.0 and 8.1. This branch is no longer actively maintained.

1.1::
    This branch is targeted at Wildfly 8.2. It has many improvements over the 1.1 release series, including support
    for SPDY and version 1.1 of the websocket specification. It also contains many bug fixes.

1.2::
    This branch is targeted at Wildfly 9.0. It added support for  HTTP2 and the ability to act as a front end
    mod_proxy load balancer.

1.3::
    The current development branch that will be part of Wildfly 10.

In order to use Undertow you need to add the following artifacts to your pom:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.11.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.11.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-websockets-jsr</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

Or for 1.1:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.8.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.8.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-websockets-jsr</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.8.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

You will only need the Undertow Servlet artifact if you wish to use Servlet in your application.

If you just want to download the jars directly you can download them from
link:http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22io.undertow%22[Maven Central].
