The easiest way to get started using Undertow is to download the
link:http://www.wildfly.org/downloads/[Wildfly Application Server].

Undertow is the default web server in Wildfly, so usage is as simple as deploying a war.

Maven
~~~~~

If you want to embed Undertow then you will most likely want to use Maven. There are currently three version branches
for Undertow:


1.3::
    A stable branch that is part of EAP 7.0, receives critical bugfix only.

1.4::
    The current stable branch, this is the recommended branch for production use.

2.0::
    The development branch for Servlet 4.0 support. This follows the 1.4.x branch, but with support for
    new Servlet 4.0 API's.


In order to use Undertow you need to add the following artifacts to your pom:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.12.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.12.Final</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
    <artifactId>undertow-websockets-jsr</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.12.Final</version>
</dependency>
----

You will only need the Undertow Servlet artifact if you wish to use Servlet in your application.

If you just want to download the jars directly you can download them from
link:http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22io.undertow%22[Maven Central].
