The Undertow 1.2 branch now supports the latest draft of the link:http://http2.github.io[HTTP2] spec. We have a demo
site up and running at link:https://http2.undertow.io[].

So far, we have verified HTTP/2 interop with the following browsers:

* Chrome Canary (41.0.2217.0)
* Firefox (Nightly build of 36.01a)
* Internet Explorer (Windows 10 Preview)

The demo site contains instructions for testing it out, including getting it running locally. The HTTP2 code is still
quite new, and will be evolving a lot over the coming months. For now most features of HTTP2 are supported, with the
exception of priority, which is ignored.
