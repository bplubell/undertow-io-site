Servlet Extensions
------------------

Servlet extensions allow you to hook into the Servlet deployment process, and modify aspect of a Servlet deployment.
In some ways they are similar to `ServletContainerInitializer` or `ServletContextListener`, however they provides much
more flexibility over what can be modified.

In order to create a ServletExtension it is necessary to implement `io.undertow.servlet.ServletExtension`, and
then add the name of your implementation class to `META-INF/services/io.undertow.servlet.ServletExtension`. When
Undertow is deploying a Servlet deployment it will load all such services from the deployments class loader, and then
invoke their `handleDeployment` method.

This method is passed an Undertow `DeploymentInfo` structure, which contains a complete and mutable description of the
deployment, my modifying this structure it is possible to change any aspect of the deployment.

The DeploymentInfo structure is the same structure that is used by the embedded API, so in effect a ServletExtension
has the same amount of flexibility that you have when using Undertow in embedded more.

Examples
